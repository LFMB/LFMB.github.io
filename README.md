The future DowneastMarkets blog/website

General Idea:
If you're reading this you're most likely a recruiter, my boss (Hi, Anthony and yes I'm getting sick of Drupal sites), Lucas Blom (Hope this my future self finds this read me funny) or someone I've managed to talk into helping with the development of this blog.
Either way, the point of this project is too kill many birds with one stone. I'm a developer, a project manager, thought leader and a constant learner.
Over the past month or two I've become a little too comfortable on the techinical side of things with my current workload of building out digital marketing platforms for FX brokers.
To get to this comfort point I've worked with around 20 - 30 different brokers (most of them starting out) and 1 exchange (NASDAQ), helped with industry event marketing that targeted every FX hotspot in the world, wore every hat imaginable in the digital marketing realm and spent many weekends studying up on the comp sci issues that I ran into during the week.
To continue the forward march of progress, I've figured it's time to start exploring the higher level topics and see if I can create a platform where other working professionals dealing with similar issues can come together and help each other out.

Technology Breakdown:
A good portion of my professional work has centered around CMSs. I've developed in Drupal, WordPress and Square Space and surprise - they are all a nightmare to develop in. 
I was on the verge of condeming all CMSs as doomed to be terrible to develop in and then I bumped into github pages' Jekyll. For the people who are not aware, github offers free web hosting for your user/ org accounts and projects.
Jekyll is a Ruby based static site generator that allows blogging to be done like a true nerd would (I've seen it marketed "As a hacker would blog").  
It uses intuative templating for anyone who knows how to use JavaScript Objects and is familiar is Handlebars, Markdown, HTML and SASS. 
Essentially, when I looked at the code layout of a Jekyll generated site I started smiling - it was exactly how I'd structure a CMS if I was dreaming.
