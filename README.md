The future DowneastMarkets blog/website

# General Idea:
I'm a developer, investor, project manager, thought leader, work horse and a constant learner. In other words, I fill many roles and always on the look out for new ways to effectively develop and hone practical workplace skills. This jekyll based blog is a manfeistion of the above mentioned attributes. My aim with this blog is to bolster and develop skills that I think will be necessary for my next career move and help others in similar situations to move forward.

# Work Background:
Over the past month or two I've become a little too comfortable on the techinical side of things with my current workload of building out digital marketing platforms for FX brokers.
To get to this comfort point I've worked with around 20 - 30 different brokers (most of them starting out) and 1 exchange (NASDAQ), helped with industry event marketing that targeted FX hotspots, wore every hat imaginable in the digital marketing realm and spent many weekends studying up on the comp sci issues that I ran into during the week.


# Technology Breakdown:
A good portion of my professional work has centered around CMSs. I've developed in Drupal, WordPress and Square Space and surprise - they are all a nightmare to develop in. 
I was on the verge of condeming all CMSs as doomed to be terrible to develop in and then I bumped into github's Jekyll. For the people who are not aware, github offers free web hosting for your user/ org accounts and projects.
Jekyll is a Ruby based static site generator that allows blogging to be done like a true nerd would (I've seen it marketed "As a hacker would blog").  
It uses intuitive templating for anyone who knows how to use JavaScript Objects and is familiar is Handlebars, Markdown, HTML and SASS. 
Essentially, when I looked at the code layout of a Jekyll generated site I started smiling - it was exactly how I'd structure a CMS in my dreams.

#To-Dos:
- look up how to declare variables in Sass (want to create mixin for font styling);
- factor out social media icons code in footer include
