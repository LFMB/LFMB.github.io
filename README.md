# General Idea:
To help make "dumb" money, intelligent.

By leveraging:
	- computer number crunching ability;
	- granular data points that are more or less accurately updated in real time; 
	- ubiquity of the ability to interact with outputs (eg: mobile, tablets and desktop devices);
	- political action;
	- transparency in thought and action;
	- recognizing that we're all human;
