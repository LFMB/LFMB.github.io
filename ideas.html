<h1>Ideas</h1>

<p>Downeast Markets is interested in the intersection between finance, government and tech. This intersection contains tremendous opportunity in expanding the ability to make intelligent decisions for everyone in our society. We are looking to create and share content that will add to this expansion.</p>


<p>The State of The Union - A per capita breakdown of the overall economic activity by state compared to the national average with the intent of figuring out if these outcomes are naturally occuring - ie random.</p>

<p>Make America Great, Again -  A "Curbside chat" by the founder of Strong Towns, Charles Marohn, that will completely change the way you look at public infrastructure. It will give you chills about our future yet leave you with some hope. What's special about his viewpoint is that neither poltical party has tarnished the Strong Town movement and his ideas should have a wide specturm of support. No one likes paying taxes - especially for feautres that are making your community weaker.</p>
