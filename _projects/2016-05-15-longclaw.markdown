## Background

A client asked us to do a massive overhaul of their current site and I am using the opprountity to create a new Drupal theme with the focus of making sitewide color changes more intuitive and module. Fun facts: the base theme is named after my current employer, Shift Forex, and the new theme is named after Jon Snow's Valyrian sword, Longclaw. Yes, it could be named something more serious or relevant to the industry our clients opperate in (FX) but I am tremendously excited about season 6 and enjoy some light banter sprinkled throughout the workday.

## Old Code 

Here's the color.inc code for our base theme. 

{% highlight php %}
<? php
// Put the logo path into JavaScript for the live preview
drupal_add_js(array('color' => array('logo' => theme_get_setting'logo', 'shift_forex'))), 'setting');

$info = array(
	// Available colors and color labels used in theme
	'fields'=> array(
		'theme' => t('Theme'),
		'lighttheme' => t('Light theme'),
		'lightertheme' => t('Lighter theme'),
		'darktheme' => t('Dark theme'),
		'alttheme' => t('Alternative theme'),
		'lightalttheme' => t('Light alternative theme'),
		'highlight' => t('Highlight'),
	),
	// Pre-defined color schemes
	'schemes' => array(
		'default' => array(
			'title' => t('Blue (default)'),
			'colors' => array(
				'theme' => '#273444',
				'lighttheme' => '#4c6685',
			i	'lightertheme' => '#8199b6',
				'darktheme' => '#1e2834',
				'alttheme' => '#bababa',
				'lightalttheme' => '#ededed',
				'highlight' => '#2e9949',
			),
		),	
	),
	// CSS files (excluding @import) to rewrite with new color scheme
	'css' => array(
		'css/styles.css',
	),
	// Files to copy
	'copy' => array(),
	// Gradient definitions 
	array( 
	// (x, y, width, height)
	'dimension' => array(0, 0, 0, 0),
	// Direction of gradient ('vertical' or 'horizontal')
	'direction' => 'vertical',
	// keys of colors to use for the gradient
	'colors' => array('top', 'bottom'),
	),
),

// Color areas to fill (x, y, width, height)
'fill' => array(),

// Reference color used for blending. Matches the base.png's colors
'blend_target' => '#ffffff',

// Preview files
// 'preview_css' => 'color/preview.css',


// 'preview_js' => 'color/preview.js',
// 'preview_html' => 'color/preview.html',
// Base file for image generation
'base_image => 'color/base.png',
);

?>
{% endhighlight %}

The above code generates something very similar to the following:

Alright, depending on your familarity with PHP, Drupal 7 theming, design rules and in general front end development you've probably have noticed numerous things. Ignore whatever you may have noticed or potentially don't understand for the time being and check out the names of the color selectors/ labels:
Theme
Highlight
Light theme
Lighter theme
Dark theme
Alternative theme
Light alternative theme

Theme, Highlight and arguably Alternative theme are the only items that someone ignorant of the inner workings of this code base could reasonably guess how a color assigned to said key would be rendered on the site. The Drupal admin interface is already scary enough (but I do think more logical than WP's) let's not make it any more so than need be. 

## Need to post new code
