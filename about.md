 This site years ago talked with glee about the coming power of: MOOCs, fast and ubiquitous internet, STEM fields, realtime society spanning granular data and innovative professionals who can skillfully weave the creative with the technical. Hello past, welcome to the future. Yes, we have entered the hypothesized stage where all these factors can, and are powerful forces in our economy and overall society. They are changing how patients receive medical care and advice, how people date and find jobs to even changing how we engage with religion. Downeast Markets in particular is interested in the intersection between these forces and two sectors: finance and government. 

Both sectors routinely deal with information asymmetry, employ people from similar backgrounds as their professional peers and rarely are penalized for outcomes that are suboptimal if they mirror the population mean even though in theory they are at the mercy of fierce and routine performance reviews. They also touch almost every part of our daily life starting with what time we wake up relative to the rest of the world to what we decide to do with our lives.
