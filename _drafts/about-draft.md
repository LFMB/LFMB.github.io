# About

Downeast Markets is interested in the intersection between finance, government and tech. This intersection contains tremendous opportunity in expanding the ability to make intelligent decisions for everyone in our society. We are looking to create and share content that will add to this expansion. 

This site years ago talked with glee about the coming power of: MOOCs, fast and ubiquitous internet, STEM fields, realtime society spanning granular data and innovative professionals who can skillfully weave the creative with the technical. Hello past, welcome to the future. Yes, we have entered the hypothesized stage where all these factors can, and are powerful forces in our economy and overall society. They are changing how patients receive medical care and advice, how people date and find jobs to even changing how we engage with religion. Downeast Markets in particular is interested in the intersection between these forces and two sectors: finance and government. 

The reason for this interest is twofold. First is due to the scale and pervasive nature of both. Every bit of a person’s life is touched by government and finance. It starts with which timezone you wake up in, spans to influencing almost all aspects of marriage and ends with how your life works gets transferred at your death.  Second deals with the the belief that both are ripe for massive overhauls. Currently both sectors routinely deal with information asymmetry, employ people from similar backgrounds as their professional peers and rarely are penalized for suboptimal outcomes especially if they mirror the population mean. This is all in spite of facing “fierce” and routine performance reviews. After considering the implications of today’s environment and the above characteristics, it is easy to see a coming wave that will destroy many previously held functions, demand drastically new skillsets, create new jobs and greatly empower previously less engaged stakeholders at relatively little cost.
